# modernizr.brightness

Feature test if brightness is present and is using the old brightnessmodel or the new one.

Older browsers use a different range in the CSS3 brightness filter. This modernizr test will feature test it and use the following classes on the html element:

    (no-)brightness
    (no-)old-brightness
